# Variables

There are three ways of declaring variables in TypeScript:

- `let`
- `const`
- `var`

In a nutshell: 
- don't use `var`
- use `let` when you want to be able to reassign the variable later
- use `const` otherwise

See [Variables.ts](Variables.ts) for examples explaining the differences between them.
