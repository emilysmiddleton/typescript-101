## Numbers

In TypeScript there is only one numeric type, `number`. 
This is stored as a `floating point` - see 
[this article](https://modernweb.com/what-every-javascript-developer-should-know-about-floating-points/) 
for a good explanation of what that means and potential pitfalls.

## Basic operators

No surprises here - basic mathematical operators are the same as in many other other languages:

| Operation | Symbol |
|:---------:|:------:|
| Add | + |
| Minus | - |
| Multiply | * |
| Divide | / |
| Modulo | % |

See [Maths.ts](Maths.ts) for examples.

## Other operations

The library Math provides many more operations:

 - abs
 - acos
 - asin
 - atan
 - ceil
 - cos
 - exp
 - floor
 - log
 - max
 - min
 - pow
 - random
 - round
 - sin
 - sqrt
 - tan

See [Maths.ts](Maths.ts) for examples.

## Suggested exercise

Write the test first!

Write a method that takes 5 numeric inputs. 
Return the difference between the minimum and maximum values,
rounded to 1 d.p.
