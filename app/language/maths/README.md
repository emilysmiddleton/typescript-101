# Maths

## Numbers

In TypeScript there is only one numeric type, `number`. 
This is stored as a `floating point` - see 
[this article](https://modernweb.com/what-every-javascript-developer-should-know-about-floating-points/) 
for a good explanation of what that means and potential pitfalls.

## Basic operators

No surprises here - basic mathematical operators are the same as in many other other languages:

| Operation | Symbol |
|:---------:|:------:|
| Add | + |
| Minus | - |
| Multiply | * |
| Divide | / |
| Modulo | % |
