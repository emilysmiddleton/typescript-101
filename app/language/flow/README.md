# Flow statements

Sometimes you want to run different parts of code, according to some condition.
This can be achieved using:

- if statements
- ternary
- switch statements

See [Flow.ts](Flow.ts) for examples.

# Running the example file

`npm run example:flow`

# Suggested exercise

Write the test first!

Write a method that determines the grade for a given test score.
- 9-10 is an A
- 7-8 is a B
- 4-6 is a C
- Anything lower is a U.


Implement once using if statements, once using switch statements.
