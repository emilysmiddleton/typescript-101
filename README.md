# typescript-101

A series of small examples of TypeScript fundamental concepts and design patterns.


# [Testing](app/testing/README.md)

- Why testing?
- Unit testing with Mocha
- Organising your tests with describe / it
- Assertions
- Running tests
- Writing your first test

# Language features

- Variables (let vs const)
- [Control flow](app/language/flow/README.md) - if, ternary and switch statements 
- Understanding truthy-ness
- [Collections](app/language/collections/README.md) - arrays, lists, sets and maps
- Object Literals
- [Logic functions](app/language/logic/README.md) - equality, and, or, not
- [Maths](app/language/maths/README.md) - common mathematical operations
- [Functions](app/language/functions/README.md)
   - Regular functions :: function add (x, y) return x + y }
   - What is a lambda
   - “Fat arrow” functions :: (x, y) => { x + y }
   - Understanding this
   - Understanding closures

# Design Patterns

- Tree traversal
- Working with collections
- map
- filter
- reduce
- Using callbacks
- Using await / async
- Understanding Promises
- Function composition
- Understanding Types

# Modelling with classes
- Interfaces
- Methods
- Type signatures
- Using type definition files

# Modules

- Organising your code
- Exporting
- Importing
- Using Other Modules
- An introduction to npm
- Adding a library
- Adding a development-time library
